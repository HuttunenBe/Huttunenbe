Hi! 👩‍💻 My name is **Beniitta**. I'm a **Full Stack Web Developer** student at **Business College Helsinki**. 💻 Currently living my dream of becoming a web developer and working hard to make it happen.

💡 I love problem solving, tackling new challenges and building things from scratch. Getting stuck on tough challenges and finally finding solutions is what keeps me going and makes me want to learn more.

🚀 I believe sharing knowledge and helping others is the key to success. My background in social services taught me that we build the world together and kindness is what makes it a better place.

🌸 What I've learned so far: 
Javascript, CSS and HTML

🐍 I'm currently learning: React, PHP and Python
