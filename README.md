👩‍💻 My name is Beniitta Huttunen. I'm a **Full Stack Web Developer** student at **Business College Helsinki**. 💻 Currently living my dream of becoming a web developer and working hard to make it happen.

💡 I love problem-solving, tackling new challenges and building things from scratch. I enjoy long complex projects that require patience and persistence. Getting stuck on tough challenges and finally cracking them is what keeps me going and makes me wanna learn more. 

🚀 I believe sharing knowledge and helping others is the key to success. My background in social services taught me that we build the world together and kindness is what makes it a better place.

🖥️  My love for computer started with my grandpa who showed me how to use one. My mom taught me that hard work makes anything possible. Working hard everyday to make them proud. 💪🏻 

🌸 What I've learned so far: Javascript, CSS and HTML.  
🐍 I'm currently learning React, PHP and Python.
