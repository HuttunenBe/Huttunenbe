Hi! 👩‍💻 My name is Beniitta Huttunen. I'm a **Full Stack Web Developer** student at **Business College Helsinki**. 💻 Currently living my dream of becoming a web developer and working hard to make it happen.

💡 I love problem-solving, tackling new challenges and building things from scratch. Getting stuck on difficult challenges and finally finding solutions is what keeps me going and makes me wanna learn more. 

🚀 I believe sharing knowledge and helping others is the key to success. My background in social services taught me that we build the world together and kindness is what makes it a better place.

🌸 What I've learned so far: Javascript, CSS and HTML.  
🐍 I'm currently learning React, PHP and Python.
